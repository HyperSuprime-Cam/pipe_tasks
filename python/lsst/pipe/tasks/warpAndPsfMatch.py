        Parameters
        ----------
        exposure : :cpp:class: `lsst::afw::image::Exposure`
            Exposure to preprocess. PSF matching is done in place.
        wcs : :cpp:class:`lsst::afw::image::Wcs`
            Desired WCS of temporary images.
        modelPsf : :cpp:class: `lsst::meas::algorithms::KernelPsf` or None
            Target PSF to which to match.
        maxBBox : :cpp:class:`lsst::afw::geom::Box2I` or None
            Maximum allowed parent bbox of warped exposure.
            If None then the warped exposure will be just big enough to contain all warped pixels;
            if provided then the warped exposure may be smaller, and so missing some warped pixels;
            ignored if destBBox is not None.
        destBBox: :cpp:class: `lsst::afw::geom::Box2I` or None
            Exact parent bbox of warped exposure.
            If None then maxBBox is used to determine the bbox, otherwise maxBBox is ignored.

        Returns
        -------
        An lsst.pipe.base.Struct with the following fields:

        exposure : :cpp:class:`lsst::afw::image::Exposure`
